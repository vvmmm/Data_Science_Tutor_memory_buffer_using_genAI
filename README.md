# Data Science Tutor App

This is a **Data Science Tutor** web application built using **Streamlit** and **LangChain**. The app provides a chatbot interface where users can ask data science-related questions, and the AI-powered tutor will answer based on predefined data science topics. The application ensures that only data science-related questions are answered, and any other type of question will redirect the user to ask data science-related queries.

## Features

- **Data Science Tutor**: The app functions as a data science tutor, answering only data science-related questions.
- **History Tracking**: The app saves past interactions in a local `history.json` file for continuity in the conversation.
- **Interactive Conversation**: Users can enter their questions, and the AI will respond with answers relevant to data science.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with **Streamlit**, providing an intuitive chat interface.
